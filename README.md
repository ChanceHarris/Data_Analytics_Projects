## A collection of data analysis projects.

This repository is mainly for projects I have done under the Coursera Google Data Analytics course.

Coursera online data analyst program has prepared me for a career as a data analyst by helping me learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. I am developing proficiency in R, Tableau, and general SQL queries.
